				<h1>Topics</h1>
				<p>The midterm covers the material presented in class through the lecture on Monday,
February 1. Specifically you will be responsible for:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Functions and Pass by Reference</li>
					<li>Use of Collections (Maps, Sets, Stacks, Queues, Vectors and Grids)</li>
					<li>Recursion (Definition and Fractals)</li>
					<li>Recursive Exploration and Backtracking</li>
					<li>Big O</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The bulk of the midterm will be build on the concepts you covered in the assignments you have completed up to this point in the course (Life, Serpinski and MetaAcademy). </p>

				<p>
					There will be five questions on the exam. The first question will ask you to trace a mystery function and determine runtime Big-O. You will only be responsible for determining Big-O of iterative functions, not recursive ones. Problems two and three will ask you to read or implement tasks that use collections. Problems four and five will ask you to read or implement tasks that require recursion.
				</p>

				<p>
					Things that will <b>not</b> be on the midterm (you may see them on previous practice exams). Structs, pointers, enums, classes or linked lists. 
				</p>
