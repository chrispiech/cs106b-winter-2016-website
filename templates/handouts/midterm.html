							The CS106B Midterm is Tuesday Feb 9th from 7pm to 9pm. If you have unavoidable conflicts with this time, please email Megan (mfaulk@stanford.edu) by Thursday, February 4th at 12pm. You should explain the reason for your conflict and include all times that you're available to take the exam on Tuesday, Feb 9th and Wednesday, Feb 10th.
		If you require OAE accommodations, you should also email Megan by Thursday at 12pm with your availability and the accommodations you require. If you haven't already sent her your OAE documentation, please attach that to the email.

				<h1>Topics</h1>
				<p>The midterm covers the material presented in class through the lecture on Monday,
February 1. Specifically you will be responsible for:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Functions and Pass by Reference</li>
					<li>Use of Collections (Maps, Sets, Stacks, Queues, Vectors and Grids)</li>
					<li>Recursion (Definition and Fractals)</li>
					<li>Recursive Exploration and Backtracking</li>
					<li>Big O</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The bulk of the midterm will be build on the concepts you covered in the assignments you have completed up to this point in the course (Life, Serpinski and MetaAcademy). </p>

				<p>
					There will be five questions on the exam. The first question will ask you to trace a mystery function and determine runtime Big-O. You will only be responsible for determining Big-O of iterative functions, not recursive ones. Problems two and three will ask you to read or implement tasks that use collections. Problems four and five will ask you to read or implement tasks that require recursion.
				</p>

				<p>
					Things that will <b>not</b> be on the midterm (you may see them on previous practice exams). Structs, pointers, enums, classes or linked lists.

				<h1>Strategies</h1>
				

				<p>
					Exams are exciting, and a good chance to learn. Sometimes they can feel competitive. Remember though that in the long term you aren't competing against the other people in the classroom. In fact they will probably be your team mates in the post Stanford world. The only race is with yourself. We don't curve the exam. If everyone does a great job of demonstrating that you understand the material, everyone will get a better grade.
				</p>

				<p>Here is a printable handout with a complete list of all CS106B library functions you may find useful on the exam and a handout on exam strategies:</p>
